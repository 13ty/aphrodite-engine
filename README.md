Aphrodite is the official backend engine for PygmalionAI. It is based on (and makes use of code from) the following projects:


- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) (CacheFlow)
- [FasterTransformer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer)
- [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM)
- [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat)
- [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot)
- [OpenAI Python Library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)

Currently a work in progress, not remotely functional.
